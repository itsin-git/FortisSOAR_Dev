#### What's Fixed
- Froze the markdown package that was used by the Utilities connector to version 3.4.4, since there is an issue with the newer version of the markdown python library that was used by the Utilities connector.
- Removed the deprecated 'Email: Extracts email's metadata from email file (Deprecated)' action from the Utilities connector actions. This action was retained till this version to ensure backward compatibility.
