#### What's Improved
- Resolved an issue where creating an alert record displayed empty values instead of null for Reporter and Reporter Email fields. This was done by updating the jinja in the "Create Record" step of the > Exchange > Extract File Indicators and Create Alert with the Linked Indicators data ingestion playbook.
- Introduced a new playbook functionality that creates MD5 FileHash indicators corresponding to the file indicators generated by the > Exchange > Create Indicators and Attachments data ingestion playbook.The Create FileHash MD5 Indicator step may need de-linking if you are not upgrading to SOAR Framework solution pack v2.2.1. For de-linking instructions refer to the section De-linking Playbook Step.
###### You must reconfigure the Exchange connector after upgrading the connection from any version lower than v4.2.0.
