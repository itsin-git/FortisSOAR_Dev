#### What's Improved

- Added a new action named "Calculate Elapsed SLA Time".
- Added the following improvements to increase the accuracy of the SLA calculations:
- Added 'Public Holidays' to the list of dates that the global holiday list takes into consideration. 
- Updated the format of 'Custom Dates' to a 'list' of custom holidays. Previously, custom dates were being sent as a string rather than a list. 
- Fixed an issue wherein the Shift Jobs Edge cases' SLA due date was calculated incorrectly.
