#### Whats Improved
- Added support for FortiSandbox cloud. The connector now supports both on-prem and FortiCloud instances.
- A new configurable option now uploads or skips the file upload to FortiSandBox. A global variable fortisandbox_upload_file when set to true uploads the file to FortiSandBox and skips the upload when set to false.
