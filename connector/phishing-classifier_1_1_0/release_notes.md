#### What's New
- Predict action now supports text-based predictions.

#### What's Fixed
- Fixed an error that was thrown when a "Custom" date range was used while configuring the phishing classifier.
- Updated the output schema for the "Predict" action to add the 'verdict' field, whose value is either "Phishing" or "Non-Phishing". 

#### Important Note
Version 1.1.0 of the Phishing Classifier connector is supported on FortiSOAR release 7.3.1 and later.
If you wish to upgrade the connector on a FortiSOAR release earlier than 7.3.1, refer to the 'Troubleshooting' section in the Phishing Classifier connector documentation.
